# Face-Mask-Accuracy-Detection
# This program is a work-in-progress. This program was coded using Python, on PyCharm. What this program does is that it connects with a webcam scans the person's face and accuracy
  on how they wear a mask. And how accurate is their face covered using the mask. 
  There have been thousands of pictures used from Google, to teach the program on differences between those wearing a mask and those who are not. And if they are wearing a mask, how accurate in terms of numeric value such as percentages, are they wearing their masks on their faces using live feed from the webcam.
